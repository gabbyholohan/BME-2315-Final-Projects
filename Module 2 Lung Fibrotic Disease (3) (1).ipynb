    "## Data-Set: \n",
    "Unpublished data was collected by the Peirce-Cottler Lab (Dept. of Biomedical Engineering) and Kim Lab (Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. The data consists of 78 black and white images at different depths of a fibrotic mouse lung. Bleomycin, an antibiotic primarily used to treat cancer that causes lung fibrosis, is injected into the mice's tracheas. After three weeks, the fibrotic mouse lungs are harvested to be biopsied. The lung was fixed, mounted in gel, and sliced with a microtome. Three immunostains, desmin, smooth muscle alpha actin, and CD-31, were added to each lung sample to identify myofibroblasts, large blood vessel smooth muscle cells, and enothelial cells respectively. The samples were placed under a microscope, capturing an image and the desmin signal was converted to a black and white image. The white parts of this image represent fibrotic lesions. The depths of the slices were measured in micrometers.\n",

    "We found that the percent of white pixels, representing extent of pulmonary fibrosis, increased with depth. Therefore, our data suggest that the extent of fibrosis is directly related to the depth of the sample from the top of the lung: the extent of fibrosis is greater in deeper pulmonary regions. With this conclusion, a medical device constructed to evaluate pulmonary fibrosis at different biopsies must have precise and accurate depth perception and must be able to collect biopsy samples at greater depths of the lung.\n",

    "Some ethical implications of this finding involve equity in healthcare, diagnoses procedures, and responsibility for patients' wellbeing. Medical devices or procedures involving more invasive technology may pose a health risk to patients both in clinical trials and as treatment. Additionally, invasive procedures may be more expensive and therefore less accessible to patients. This inequity may result in diagnoses gaps and unerestimating the severity of IPF if less invasive technology collects biopsies from shallower regions of the lung. Healthcare providers must be aware that biopsy samples from shallower regions may not accurately predict the progression of IPF."

    "Our data were gathered from biopsies of mice lungs, which differ in size and orientation from human lungs. Mouse lungs are much smaller than human lungs, and mice are quadrupedal while humans are bipedal, potentially impacting the extent of fibrosis in different regions of the lung. Therefore, we cannot be entirely certain that our findings apply to the human lung until human samples are collected and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work may include running human biopsy samples through our program to better predict degree of fibrosis at different lung depths in humans or altering the computational model to perform interpolations with other shapes such as quadratic or cubic. The reasoning behind an increasing degree of fibrosis in deeper regions of the lung is another question delivered by our data analysis. Researching why this is the case could further aid medical device design and potential treatment for IPF."

    "* 10/7/2025 - Both team members worked to debug code for creating the .csv file and interpolating data points.\n",
    "* 10/9/2025 - Both team members explored ways to expand on the current project model (including all data points instead of 6, messing with different curves of best fit)\n",
    "* 10/14/2025 - Library meeting to plan presentation and sort out jupyter notebook logistics. Divided responsibilities for slides on the presentation: Analysis and Verification (Nolan), Goal, Background and Ethical Implications (Gabby). For notebook logistics:\n",
    "- Nolan: finishing analysis code for 78 images, ensure output plots are accurate, finish verification and validation.\n",
    "- Gabby: finish ethical implications, conclusions, future work and limitations."
